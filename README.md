### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m Simina and I lead the Special Projects team at GitHub, a lovely team of wonderful PMs & engineers. We like to ship often (and I mean _often_) and we are on a mission to make GitHub more delightful to ALL developers. ðŸ¥· 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about leading inter-disciplinary teams, living a more fulfilling life and managing toddler tantrums.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my approach to having a high impact with the lowest effort possible. I will talk about how to find easy solutions, how to say "no", and if you're interested, effortless sourdough baking and weekly meal planning.
