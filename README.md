### Hey there ğŸ‘‹ 

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m Simina and I lead the Code & Experiences PM team at GitHub. I care about beatiful user experiences, leading high-performing teams with kindness, and having clear priorities.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about leading inter-disciplinary teams, living a more fulfilling life and managing toddler tantrums.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my approach to having a high impact with the lowest effort possible. I will talk about how to find easy solutions, how to say "no", and if you're interested, effortless sourdough baking and weekly meal planning.
